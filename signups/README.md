- Specific AI tools used
  - Cursor (pro plan).
- Development approach and prompting strategies
  - leaned into vibe-coding with Agent mode, typically relying on testing the dev site to prompt and suggest changes rather than reviewing every line of code changed.
- Time investment and iterations required
  - less than 4 hours include time to set up and deploy to Heroku.
- Lessons learned and tool limitations encountered
  - Wow! This was my first real experience with pure *vibe coding* and I am impressed. Granted, having a great deal of prompting and software development experience helped me feel confident with how to describe what I wanted, I really didn't put that much thought into guiding the agent.
- Code quality observations
  - No idea! I wanted to really lean into a behavior-driven prompting by primarily interacting with the dev site to guide the agent. However, there were times were pictures and prompting were not cutting it and I just made the simple changes to the code.
