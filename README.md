## About This Repository

This repository serves as my personal showcase for exploring the capabilities and workflows of modern GenAI-powered development tools. Rather than traditional hand-coded projects, this site demonstrates how AI-assisted development can be used to rapidly prototype and deploy functional web applications.

## Philosophy & Transparency

I believe in being completely transparent about my development process. **This repository primarily consists of AI-generated code** created through various GenAI tools, with my role being:

- **Project conceptualization** and requirement definition
- **Tool selection** and workflow design  
- **Quality assurance** and testing
- **Integration** and deployment oversight
- **Learning** from the AI-assisted development process

This is not traditional "handcoded" work, and I don't claim it to be. Instead, it's an exploration of how developers can leverage AI tools effectively while maintaining quality standards.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Django (Python)
- **Architecture:** Individual Django apps per project
- **Deployment:** Heroku
- **Database:** Heroku PostgreSQL

## GenAI Tools Used

This project leverages various AI-powered development tools, including:

- **Cursor** - AI-powered code editor
- **Claude** - Chat for brainstorming projects and recommended approaches

## Development Goals

1. **Tool Exploration** - Test capabilities and limitations of different GenAI development tools
2. **Workflow Optimization** - Develop efficient AI-assisted development patterns
3. **Quality Assessment** - Evaluate code quality, maintainability, and performance of AI-generated code
4. **Learning Documentation** - Share insights about effective AI-assisted development
5. **Rapid Prototyping** - Demonstrate speed of development with AI assistance

## Individual Project Notes

Each Django app includes its own README with:
- Specific AI tools used
- Development approach and prompting strategies
- Time investment and iterations required
- Lessons learned and tool limitations encountered
- Code quality observations

## Why This Approach?

This repository represents my belief that:

- **Transparency** in AI-assisted development is crucial
- **Tool mastery** is as valuable a skill as traditional coding
- **Rapid iteration** enables more experimentation and learning
- **Quality can be maintained** with proper oversight and testing
- **The future of development** will increasingly involve AI collaboration
